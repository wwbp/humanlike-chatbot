# cloudfront.tf — the CDN that serves the React frontend to end users
#
# CloudFront sits in front of the frontend S3 bucket and handles:
#   - HTTPS termination (the S3 bucket itself serves no HTTP)
#   - Global caching so files load quickly regardless of where the user is
#   - SPA routing: any URL that doesn't match a file returns index.html
#     so that React Router can handle client-side navigation
#
# I use Origin Access Control (OAC), the modern replacement for the legacy
# Origin Access Identity (OAI). OAC signs requests with SigV4 and works
# with S3 server-side encryption. I do NOT include an s3_origin_config block
# — that is the OAI pattern and conflicts with OAC.
#
# The S3 bucket policy that grants CloudFront read access is at the bottom
# of this file because it references both the bucket (from s3.tf) and the
# CloudFront distribution ARN (defined here). Keeping them together avoids
# a circular dependency that would break `terraform plan`.

# with S3. S3 checks the request signature against this OAC's ARN.
