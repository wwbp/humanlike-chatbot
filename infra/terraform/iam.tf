# iam.tf — who is allowed to do what in AWS
#
# I create three sets of IAM resources:
#
#   1. EB instance role + instance profile
#      This is the identity that the Elastic Beanstalk EC2 instances assume.
#      It lets the application read/write the data S3 bucket, call AWS Bedrock
#      for AI models, and read SSM parameters — all without hardcoding any
#      AWS credentials in the application code or environment variables.
#
#   2. EB service role
#      This is the identity that the Elastic Beanstalk service itself uses
#      to manage health monitoring and platform updates on my behalf.
#      Required by EB since October 2024 when launch configurations were
#      deprecated in favour of launch templates.
#
#   3. GitHub Actions OIDC provider + deployment role
#      This lets GitHub Actions deploy to this infrastructure without storing
#      any long-lived AWS access keys in GitHub secrets. Instead, GitHub's
#      OIDC token is exchanged for short-lived AWS credentials at run time.
#      I scope the trust to exactly this organisation and repository so no
#      other repo can assume this role.
